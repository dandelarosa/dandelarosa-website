  <h1>Welcome!</h1>
  <p>Hi! I'm a longtime engineer and overall creative person. Throughout my life I've explored numerous fields such as software engineering, web development, and game design.</p>
  <p>For the past five years I've worked at a software startup called <a href="https://www.makr.co/" target="_blank">Makr</a>, a web app for designing logos and print materials. My work began solely with native iOS development but my skillset has expanded to include Ruby (Rails, Sinatra, and Grape), HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and Node.JS. During that time I've also improved my understanding of database systems, design patterns, and DevOps. Outside of technical skills, I learned to collaborate effectively with project managers and other staff and make the most out of their small team.</p>
