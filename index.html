  <h1>Welcome!</h1>

  <p>Hi! I'm an experienced software engineer who likes to contribute to game development and other creative outlets.</p>

  <p>I currently work at a software startup called <a href="https://www.makr.co/" target="_blank">Makr</a>, an app for designing logos and print materials. My work began with native iOS development but my skillset expanded to include Ruby (Sinatra, Grape, and Rails), HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and Node.js in the past five years. I also used that time to improve my understanding of database systems, design patterns, and DevOps. Outside of technical skills, I learned to collaborate effectively with project managers and other staff in order for our team to make the most out of our limited resources. View my profile on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dandelarosa/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dandelarosa" target="_blank">GitHub</a> for more info on my professional experience.</p>

  <p>Additionally I have been making games for over a decade, mainly as a hobby and for school assignments. Recently I have joined <a href="https://gamkedo.com/" target="_blank">Gamkedo Club</a> to hone in on my programming and collaboration skills and to network with other aspiring game developers. View my <a href="games">games</a> page to see what I've being working on.</p>

  <p>If none of those catch your fancy, here are some other topics we can discuss:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Other online media, such as podcasts, blogs, and YouTube videos</li>
    <li>Tech networking in New York City</li>
    <li>Philanthropy and social entrepreneurship opportunities</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Contact <a href="https://twitter.com/dandelarosadev" target="_blank">@dandelarosadev</a> if you are interested in a collaboration.</p>
